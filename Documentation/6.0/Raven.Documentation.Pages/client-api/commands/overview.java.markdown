# Commands Overview
---

{NOTE: }

* RavenDB's Client API is structured in layers.  
  At the highest layer, you interact with the [document store](../../client-api/what-is-a-document-store) and the [document session](../../client-api/session/what-is-a-session-and-how-does-it-work),  
  which handle most common database tasks like loading, saving, and querying documents.

* Beneath this high-level interface are Operations and Commands:

   * **Operations**:  
  
     * Operations provide management functionality outside the session's context,  
       like creating a database, performing bulk actions, or managing server-wide configurations.
     
     * Learn more about Operations in [what are Operations](../../client-api/operations/what-are-operations).

   * **Commands**:  

     * All high-level methods and Operations are built on top of Commands.  
       Commands form the lowest-level operations that directly communicate with the server.  
     
     * For example, a sessionâ€™s _Load_ method translates internally to a _LoadOperation_,  
       which ultimately relies on a _GetDocumentsCommand_ to fetch data from the server.
      
     * Commands are responsible for sending the appropriate request to the server using a `Request Executor`,  
       and parsing the server's response.
     
     * All commands can be executed using either the Store's _Request Executor_ or the Session's _Request Executor_,  
       regardless of whether the command is session-related or not.

* This layered structure lets you work at any level, depending on your needs.
