# Commands Overview
---

{NOTE: }

* RavenDB's Client API is structured in layers.  
  At the highest layer, you interact with the [document store](../../client-api/what-is-a-document-store) and the [document session](../../client-api/session/what-is-a-session-and-how-does-it-work),  
  which handle most common database tasks like loading, saving, and querying documents.

* Beneath this high-level interface are Operations and Commands:

    * **Operations**:

        * Operations provide management functionality outside the session's context,  
          like creating a database, performing bulk actions, or managing server-wide configurations.

        * Learn more about Operations in [what are Operations](../../client-api/operations/what-are-operations).

    * **Commands**:

        * All high-level methods and Operations are built on top of Commands.  
          Commands form the lowest-level operations that directly communicate with the server.

        * For example, a sessionâ€™s _Load_ method translates internally to a _LoadOperation_,  
          which ultimately relies on a _GetDocumentsCommand_ to fetch data from the server.

        * Commands are responsible for sending the appropriate request to the server using a `Request Executor`,  
          and parsing the server's response.

        * All commands can be executed using either the Store's _Request Executor_ or the Session's _Request Executor_,  
          regardless of whether the command is session-related or not.

* This layered structure lets you work at any level, depending on your needs.

* In this page:
    * [Execute command - using the Store](../../client-api/commands/overview#execute-command---using-the-store)
    * [Execute command - using the Session](../../client-api/commands/overview#execute-command---using-the-session)
    * [Available commands](../../client-api/commands/overview#available-commands)

{PANEL: Execute command - using the Store}

This example shows how to execute the low-level `CreateSubscriptionCommand` using the **Store**.  
(For examples of creating a subscription using higher-level methods, see [subscription creation examples](../../client-api/data-subscriptions/creation/examples)).
