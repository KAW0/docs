# Perform a Faceted (Aggregated) Search

---

{NOTE: }

* A **Faceted Search** provides an efficient way to explore and navigate through large datasets or search results.  

* To make a faceted search,  
  a static-index must be defined for the fields you want to query and apply facets on.  
  Please refer to article **Query by Facets** under [Indexes > Querying > Faceted search](../../../indexes/querying/faceted-search).
